# Goals
Bite-sized cooperation oriented games.
1. No purchasables with robux or in-game currency. We want you to enjoy the game purely for the game itself. If you want to support us, then we have donation boards set up in these games where you can support our efforts.
2. No manipulation tactics (e.g daily rewards). We want you to enjoy the game purely for itself, not because we coerced you into it.
3. No ranking system. Once again, we don't want you to play for a stupid mineral, and also, we don't like sweaty people playing our games...
4. Community oriented. It will get harder to maintain this rule as the community gets bigger, so PLEASE give us backlash if we ever release an update that you disapprove of and didn't warn you about.

tl;dr We want you to feel heard and play the games purely because you enjoy them.

# Repos
These are the repositories that affect every other repo/game.

[Our license](https://github.com/spcy-ivy/CPL)

[Our colorscheme](https://github.com/spcy-ivy/velvet-colorscheme)

Feel free to contribute to both of these!

Every other repo should just be our games!

# Why Github?
Yeah yeah I know this place is proprietary and riddled with ai, but nobody knows what a Gitlab or a Codeberg is.

Also because I can't afford sourcehut hahahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahahha.
